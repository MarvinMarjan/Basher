# Basher

**Basher** is an indie program that I decided to try to create, it is an attempt to **copy** the cmd from the **Windows**, but adding some unique features.
it is currently written in [C++](https://en.cppreference.com), although I am thinking of adding other languages, such as [Python](https://python.org) for automations, although it is not very optimized.
I will try to do at least one update per week on this project, I would appreciate any kind of suggestions to add **:)**.
