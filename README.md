# Basher

**Basher** is an indie program that I decided to try to create, it is an attempt to **copy** the cmd from the **Windows**, but adding some unique features.
it is currently written in [C++](https://en.cppreference.com), although I am thinking of adding other languages, such as [Python](https://python.org) for automations, although it is not very optimized.
I will try to do at least one update per week on this project, I would appreciate any kind of suggestions to add **:)**.

Basher's main goal is to be an improved CMD, with features and functions that would help developers like me in their day to day work, obviously he doesn't have many resources at the moment due to the fact that I started the project recently, but hopefully in the future many people can be helped with this project
